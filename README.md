# WorkersSnowflake
An implementation of Twitter Snowflake in Cloudflare Workers with 42 bits for the epoch, 9 bits for the node ID and 12 bits for the sequence ID.

# Possible issues
Although node IDs are generated by colo name, collisions still may occur due to the way autoscaling works if there are a lot of requests.

Cloudflare currently has 200+ datacentres, we use 9 bits for the node ID so we have a limit of 512 locations, even if Cloudflare expands above this amount it still shouldn't be an issue depending on the distribution of the clients that request Snowflakes.
